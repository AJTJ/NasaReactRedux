Notes//

-Class Based Component will carry the state
-We need state because we need a way to save what's happening with our dynamic application 

E.g.
we have a counter with a starting number at zero. The initial state is zero. The user clicks on the button. Hmmâ€¦ what next? How are we gonna fit the pieces together and more importantly increment or decrement the number? We need some kind of dynamic mechanism to represent our actions and convert it into representational feedback/data. We call it State. Once you use stateâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou canâ€™t live without it. ðŸ’ª
